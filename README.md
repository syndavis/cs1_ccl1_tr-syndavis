# Collaborate, Code, and Learn 1 - 25pts
*Introduction to Programming*

**24 Hour Deadline Extension Token Cost: 1**

## Introduction
This is your first Collaborate, Code, and Learn (CCL) assignment. The first two CCL assignments are worth 25 points each
while the rest of them are worth 30. These generally consist of a mix of custom questions and questions from or about
components in the textbook.

In this assignment, you will be presented with a set of problems. Each problem has a point total and may break down the
points into smaller components. For each problem, it will indicate the corresponding file to update. Here is an example
of the syntax:
#### File: `Folder/Subfolder/File.java`

Points are described as either:
1. **Point Breakdown:** Completing the tasks awards the described points.
2. **Point Categories:** You earn the points depending on the category that best described your answer.

## Problem 1 -  Troubleshoot a Recipe - 10pts
#### [AI - Not Allowed]
#### File `src/ProblemOne.java`
#### Requires - Using the extended description of a commit to answer

Suppose you are a developer working on a shopping list application. Your coworker is having trouble writing code to display the
following list:
```
Shopping List for a Cake:
1. Flour
2. Eggs
3. Sugar
4. Butter
5. Frosting
```

Instead, the code they wrote produces this:
```
Shopping List for a Cake:1. Flour
2. Eggs

3. Sugar4. Butter5. Frosting
```

1. [7pts] Troubleshoot their code in `ProblemOne.java` so that it produces the text formatted as intended.
2. [3pts] Write in the extended description of a commit how you troubleshooted the program.

## Problem 2 - Implement the Equation - 5pts
#### [AI - Not Allowed]
#### Files `src/ProblemTwo.java`

The equation of the area of a triangle is: $Area = \frac{base * height}{2}$

Write a program in `src/ProblemTwo.java` to calculate the area of a triangle given a base of 3.5 and a height of 2.1. Be
sure that your program includes one or more comments indicating how it works.

1. [3.5pts] Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle as indicated above.
2. [1.5pts] Write comments that indicate what your code does.


## Problem 3 - Teach on a Code Animation - 5pts: Book Code Animation and Live Example 1.3
#### [AI - Not Allowed]
#### File: `README.md`

In chapter 1.7 of the textbook, CodeAnimation 1.3 and LiveExample 1.3 provide a demonstration of a Java program running.

Suppose that you are studying with a classmate who is really struggling to try and implement the live example on their own.
Write an explanation in your own words, as if explaining it to someone trying to learn but having a hard time, how the example
and animation work. What concepts do they cover and what would you recommend they practice to learn more?

Write your answer below!
```
Problem 1.3 in chapter 1.7 shows us how to perform math equations and display them in java. The animation shows us what 
the code is supposed to look like while the example has us fill in some missing values. To start, our first line has our 
class name. This basically expresses what we want we want the name/theme of this main set of code to be. The second line
is a line of code that we use to set our main method for a program. A method is a collection of statements that we use to 
perform an operation, and the "main" method is where we tell our program to start reading those statements. In this case, 
that line would look like:
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
Within the parenthesis, we are basically telling the code that "you are gonna write this based from what I type." Following 
that, there are a set of curly brackets that must be written within the code, so that the code can know to evaluate the 
lines within those curly brackets. Line 3 of the code is a print line. System.out.print tells the program to display what 
is written within its parenthesis. In line, 3, the expression is first written within a set of quotation marks. When a string 
is written in a set of quotation marks, it tells the program to display that line as a message. Following that line, line 
4 has us fill in the code per the animation example. The same expression is then written again, but without quotation marks. 
This tells the code to actually evaluate that expression, and display the answer as a numeric value. Again, line 3 is 
within parenthesis, so it displays the full equation out as a string, then, line 4 evaluates that same expression into 
an actual numeric answer. This problem is a simple showing of how to run a mathematical expression in java.

```
#### Point Categories:
1. [5pts] - You provide an explanation including concepts to study as described above.
2. [3pts]  - You give a textbook explanation that would be hard to follow by someone who is trying to learn but having difficulty.
3. [2.5pts] - Your explanation is correct but somewhat incomplete, missing critical details about some of the code.
4. [0pts]  - You do not provide an explanation or provide a poor explanation that is very incomplete or is inaccurate in a significant manner.


## Problem 4 - 5pts: Book Problem 1.9
#### [AI - Not Allowed]
#### File: `src/ProblemFour.java`
Lookup problem 1.9 in *Chapter 1: Programming Exercises From The Book*. This sub-chapter is at the end of chapter 1. It
is **not** part of the Self-Check questions at the end of subchapters.

For you solution, you should include comments to describe what your program does.

#### Point Categories:
1. [5pts] - Your code successfully completes the task as described and includes descriptive comments.
2. [4pts]  - Your code successfully completes the task as described and includes poor or no comments.
3. [2pts]  - Your code fails to complete the task with only minor corrections required to fix it. Comments show that you planned a correct strategy.
4. [1pts]  - Your code fails to complete the task. Comments shows you planned a correct strategy but were unable to complete it.
5. [0pts]  - Your code fails to complete the task. No evidence that you planned a correct strategy in your submission.
